## Integration with Event Message Pattern Using Ballerina Integrator (BI)

### Overview

The **Event Message** notifies other applications about something that happened. Unlike document message, the focus is on the timing of the message rather than the content. 
This integration is built using **Ballerina Integrator (BI)** to showcase the ease of implementing such patterns within a low-code integration environment.

For more detailed information on the **Event Message** pattern, visit the [Event Message documentation](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/EventMessage.html).
